# osuHOW frontend
## fork of [osuHOW's fork](https://github.com/osuHOW/frontend) of [Ainu's fork](https://github.com/osuthailand/frontend) of [frontend](https://github.com/osuripple/frontend) by [Ripple](https://ripple.moe/)
this frontend serves as the primary way to access osuHOW's website.

Running this code should be as simple as typing

```

if not, you can try deleting the vendor folder and trying again.

at the moment, this code only works on linux
