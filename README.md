# osuHOW frontend
## fork of [RealistikOsu's fork](https://github.com/RealistikOsu/hanayo) of [Ainu's fork](https://github.com/osuthailand/hanayo) of [Hanayo](https://github.com/osuripple/hanayo) by [Ripple](https://ripple.moe/)

This is a super experimental redesign of hanayo, it will eventually replace our existing frontend design.
If you are looking for a frontend to run your own server, this is far from completion, and it won't be for at least another six months (realistically much more), until then, you should check out [Akatsuki's fork of hanayo](https://github.com/osuAkatsuki/hanayo) or [Varkaria's guweb](https://github.com/Varkaria/guweb)

Running this code should be as simple as typing
```
go get
go build
./frontend
```

if not, you can try deleting the vendor folder and trying again.

at the moment, this code only works on linux
