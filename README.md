# osuHOW frontend
## fork of [RealistikOsu's fork](https://github.com/RealistikOsu/hanayo) of [Ainu's fork](https://github.com/osuthailand/hanayo) of [Hanayo](https://github.com/osuripple/hanayo) by [Ripple](https://ripple.moe/)
this frontend serves as the primary way to access osuHOW's website.

Running this code should be as simple as typing
```
go get
go build
./hanayo
```

if not, you can try deleting the vendor folder and trying again.

at the moment, this code only works on linux
