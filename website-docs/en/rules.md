<h4 class="cenetered">Rules may be changed at any time as we see fit.<br>New rules may or may not be retroactive at our own discretion.</h4>

<h3><i class="game icon"></i> General rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **restriction or ban, temporary or permanent**, depending on the gravity._
#### _NOTE: If you login with a modified client or any cheats we may ban you regardless of if you submitted any plays with them or not_

1. **Cheating** and any other form of hacking are strictly prohibited.
2. **Edited clients,** are not allowed without permission, with osu!ui.dll modifications as a sole exception. (Permission is only given when using a client provided by osuHOW, or if you ask for permission to use an edited client and it is granted.)
3. **Shared or boosted** accounts are not allowed.
4. Don't try to **exploit the server**. If you intend to report a vulnerability, do so responsibly and by contacting the developers.
5. Use an **appropriate username** (no offensive or **stolen names**, e.g. you can't choose to be Cookiezi, WubWoofWolf, Rafis, _index, etc...)
6. **Don't abuse our patience;** while we try to best satisfy our users' need, if you repeatedly infringe our rules or abuse services provided by the staff (e.g. appealing and name changing) (with particular regard to users who also disrespect our staff's efforts, passively or actively, or are otherwise toxic within the community), we will first warn you, and if it comes to it we will offer an ultimatum. If you refuse or otherwise don't change your behaviour, we'll have no choice but to ban you.
7. If you are playing on touchscreen you must play on a client that has the touchscreen nerf (added in late 2016 iirc).

<h3><i class="comment icon"></i> Chat rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **silence**._

These apply to the in-game chat only, The discord has its own rules which are a bit less strict.

1. Avoid any kind of insults to people. Try to be friendly. If not, try to discuss in a constructive manner.
2. Racial slurs are absolutely not allowed. Terms like "retarded", and "autistic" are fine on objects, definitely not on people.
3. Don't **spam or flood**, unless you're occasionally sending a link to e.g. Twitch when you're streaming osuHOW when no discussion is going on.
4. Any kind of **illegal content, warez, or viruses** is strictly prohibited. (This includes posting parts of source code that you have no legal right to share.)
5. No NSFW or gore content.
6. Unless it's a language channel, please speak English.
7. Don't make any kind of **cheating accusation** (Use #playerreports on discord or report the person you suspect to a Community Manager)
8. Remember also to follow the **General rules** above!

<h3><i class="user icon"></i> Profile rules</h3>

#### _Any violation of the rules in this section will result in a **silence and userpage/avatar reset**._

1. **NSFW and offensive** avatars/userpage contents are not allowed.
2. Don't link to **illegal stuff**/porn/warez/viruses/<s>bonzi buddy</s> on userpages.
3. Do not use **offensive custom badges** and do not **pretend to be someone else with your custom badge**. If you abuse the badges system, you'll be silenced and you won't be able to edit your custom badge anymore.

<h3><i class="file text outline icon"></i> Cheat/multiaccount policy</h3>

#### _This is how we handle cheaters and multiaccounters on osuHOW._

1. Cheating and multiaccount is strictly prohibited.
2. It doesn't matter if you cheated on any other osu! server - we only care about what you did on osuHOW.
3. Multiaccounts are **NOT** allowed, with the **SOLE EXCEPTION OF CHAT BOTS AND TOURNEY ACCOUNTS**.  If you are developing a chat bot or hosting a tourney and need a seperate account for it, ask in the discord.
4. We reserve the right to change these rules as we see fit.

<h3><i class="list layout icon"></i> Miscellaneous</h3>

1. You can change your profile flag by asking in the discord.
2. Name changes are handled through our discord.
